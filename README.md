# rubricinator

The rubricinator helps us manage rubrics.
We can create and assign rubrics for educational assessments.  We can also evaluate an individual's progress against a rubric.



## Setup

It's rails: `bundle install; rake db:setup`

## Testing

`rspec` # using the "new" defaults, see spec/spec_helper.rb.
